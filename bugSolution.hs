The solution involves defining the `undefinedFunction`:

```haskell
undefinedFunction :: Int -> Int
undefinedFunction x = x * 2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = undefinedFunction 5
  print result
```

Alternatively, you could handle the potential error with `maybe` or other error handling techniques if the function is legitimately undefined under certain conditions.
